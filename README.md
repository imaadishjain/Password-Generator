# Password-Generator

Namaste

I'm glad to share my first project of JavaScript, Password Generator ðŸ”‘.

Technologies used->HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

This project is all about the customisable password generation in which users  can select the type characters they want to include along with the password length.

Extra functionality of this project is the Strengths field which informs the users about their generated password strength i.e

ðŸ”´-weak.
ðŸŸ¡-normal.
ðŸŸ¢-strong.

With the help of these indicators users can re-select their input filed in order to have strong password.

All the password generated is not predictable because random function of JavaScript and FISHER YETS SHUFFLING ALGORITHM is used to generate a password string.


After, the completion of this project I got to know about the wide diversity of JavaScript, use of DSA and importance of JavaScript in Development.
